* Agent-environment interface
* Tasks: episodic or continuing
* State-space: n-dimensional discrete or continuous
* Action-space: m-dimensional discrete or continuous
* Sampling: online or offline (no further interaction with the environment)
* Learning: on-policy (learn the value of the policy used to make decisions) or off-policy (behavior differs from the policy being evaluated)
* Prediction (predict the value): dynamic programming, monte carlo, temporal difference
* Control (choose the action): exploration vs exploitation, SARSA (on-policy, learns the value of the policy being followed), Q-learning (off-policy, always learns the optimal policy independent of the policy followed)
* ???: table, linear function approximation, non-linear function approximation
* Value iteration: state, afterstate, action
* Action selection: greedy, e-greedy, softmax
* Elementary methods: dynamic programming, monte carlo, temporal-difference TD(0)
* Combined methods: eligibility traces TD(lambda)
* Function approximation: gradient descent
* Linear function approximation: gradient descent over a linear function
* Non-linear function approximation: artificial neural networks using gradient descent error backpropagation
